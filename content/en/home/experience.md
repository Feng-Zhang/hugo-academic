        Focusing on the prognostic biomarkers for different cancers:

        * Comprehensive analysis of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) associated competing endogenous RNA network in Wilmsâ€™ tumor 
        * Identified integrated mRNA-lncRNA signature to improve prognosis prediction of Cholangiocarcinoma

        Focusing on molecular characterization of feed efficiency related traits in beef cattle through whole genome-wide sequencing (WGS) data analyses:

        - Estimated phenotypic and genetic relationships of residual feed intake measures and their component traits with fatty acid composition in subcutaneous adipose of beef cattle
        - Imputed genotype from 50K bovine beadchip to whole genome wide sequence using FImpute, Beagle and Impute2 software
        - Performed genome wide association analysis (GWAS) for feed efficient and carcass traits in Canadian beef cattle by GCTA software 
        - Compared the accuracy of genomic prediction for feed efficiency and carcass merit traits in within and across beef cattle using GBLUP, BayesB, BayesR and BayesRC.

        Focusing on the genetic architecture of complex traits in pig through WGS data analyses :

        - Performed GWAS for 15 hematological traits in 495 Chinese Sutai pigs 
        - Developed an R package (RegionPlot) to visualize a region of genome wide associate study results
        - Contributed to identify the candidate loci and adaptive evolutionary history of European pigs and Chinese Tibetan boars by WGS 
        - Contributed to impute the WGS of 418 Sutai pigs and perform association tests to detected the missing QTL for lumbar number
